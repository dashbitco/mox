# Mox

[![Hex.pm](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/mox.svg?style=flat-square)](https://hex.pm/packages/mox)

Mox is a library for defining concurrent mocks in Elixir.

The library follows the principles outlined in ["Mocks and explicit contracts"](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2015/10/mocks-and-explicit-contracts/), summarized below:

  1. No ad-hoc mocks. You can only create mocks based on behaviours

  2. No dynamic generation of modules during tests. Mocks are preferably defined in your `test_helper.exs` or in a `setup_all` block and not per test

  3. Concurrency support. Tests using the same mock can still use `async: true`

  4. Rely on pattern matching and function clauses for asserting on the
     input instead of complex expectation rules

[See the documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/mox) for more information.

## Installation

Just add `mox` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:mox, "~> 0.3", only: :test}
  ]
end
```

Mox should be automatically started unless the `:applications` key is set inside `def application` in your `mix.exs`. In such cases, you need to [remove the `:applications` key in favor of `:extra_applications`](https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2017/01/05/elixir-v1-4-0-released/#application-inference) or call `Application.ensure_all_started(:mox)` in your `test/test_helper.exs`.
