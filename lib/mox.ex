defmodule Mox do
  @moduledoc """
  Mox is a library for defining concurrent mocks in Elixir.

  The library follows the principles outlined in
  ["Mocks and explicit contracts"](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2015/10/mocks-and-explicit-contracts/),
  summarized below:

    1. No ad-hoc mocks. You can only create mocks based on behaviours

    2. No dynamic generation of modules during tests. Mocks are preferably defined
       in your `test_helper.exs` or in a `setup_all` block and not per test

    3. Concurrency support. Tests using the same mock can still use `async: true`

    4. Rely on pattern matching and function clauses for asserting on the
       input instead of complex expectation rules

  ## Example

  As an example, imagine that your library defines a calculator behaviour:

      defmodule MyApp.Calculator do
        @callback add(integer(), integer()) :: integer()
        @callback mult(integer(), integer()) :: integer()
      end

  If you want to mock the calculator behaviour during tests, the first step
  is to define the mock with `defmock/2`, usually in your `test_helper.exs`:

      Mox.defmock(MyApp.CalcMock, for: MyApp.Calculator)

  Now in your tests, you can define expectations with `expect/4` and verify
  them via `verify_on_exit!/1`:

      use ExUnit.Case, async: true

      import Mox

      # Make sure mocks are verified when the test exits
      setup :verify_on_exit!

      test "invokes add and mult" do
        MyApp.CalcMock
        |> expect(:add, fn x, y -> x + y end)
        |> expect(:mult, fn x, y -> x * y end)

        assert MyApp.CalcMock.add(2, 3) == 5
        assert MyApp.CalcMock.mult(2, 3) == 6
      end

  In practice, you will have to pass the mock to the system under the test.
  If the system under test relies on application configuration, you should
  also set it before the tests starts to keep the async property. Usually
  in your config files:

      config :my_app, :calculator, MyApp.CalcMock

  Or in your `test_helper.exs`:

      Application.put_env(:my_app, :calculator, MyApp.CalcMock)

  All expectations are defined based on the current process. This
  means multiple tests using the same mock can still run concurrently
  unless the Mox is set to global mode. See the "Multi-process collaboration"
  section.

  Especially if you put the mock into the config/application environment you
  might want the implementation to fall back to the original implementation
  when no expectations are defined. `stub_with/2` is just what you need! Given
  that `MyApp.TestCalculator` is the implementation you are mocking you can
  do the following in your test (for instance inside `setup`):

      Mox.stub_with(MyApp.CalcMock, MyApp.TestCalculator)

  Now, if no expectations are defined it will call the implementation in
  `MyApp.TestCalculator`.

  ## Multiple behaviours

  Mox supports defining mocks for multiple behaviours.

  Suppose your library also defines a scientific calculator behaviour:

      defmodule MyApp.ScientificCalculator do
        @callback exponent(integer(), integer()) :: integer()
      end

  You can mock both the calculator and scientific calculator behaviour:

      Mox.defmock(MyApp.SciCalcMock, for: [MyApp.Calculator, MyApp.ScientificCalculator])

  ## Compile-time requirements

  If the mock needs to be available during the project compilation, for
  instance because you get undefined function warnings, then instead of
  defining the mock in your `test_helper.exs`, you should instead define
  it under `test/support/mocks.ex`:

      Mox.defmock(MyApp.CalcMock, for: MyApp.Calculator)

  Then you need to make sure that files in `test/support` get compiled
  with the rest of the project. Edit your `mix.exs` file to add the
  `test/support` directory to compilation paths:

      def project do
        [
          ...
          elixirc_paths: elixirc_paths(Mix.env),
          ...
        ]
      end

      defp elixirc_paths(:test), do: ["test/support", "lib"]
      defp elixirc_paths(_),     do: ["lib"]

  ## Multi-process collaboration

  Mox supports multi-process collaboration via two mechanisms:

    1. explicit allowances
    2. global mode

  The allowance mechanism can still run tests concurrently while
  the global one doesn't. We explore both next.

  ### Explicit allowances

  An allowance permits a child process to use the expectations and stubs
  defined in the parent process while still being safe for async tests.

      test "invokes add and mult from a task" do
        MyApp.CalcMock
        |> expect(:add, fn x, y -> x + y end)
        |> expect(:mult, fn x, y -> x * y end)

        parent_pid = self()

        Task.async(fn ->
          MyApp.CalcMock |> allow(parent_pid, self())
          assert MyApp.CalcMock.add(2, 3) == 5
          assert MyApp.CalcMock.mult(2, 3) == 6
        end)
        |> Task.await
      end

  Note: if you're running on Elixir 1.8.0 or greater and your concurrency comes
  from a `Task` then you don't need to add explicit allowances. Instead
  `$callers` is used to determine the process that actually defined the
  expectations.

  ### Global mode

  Mox supports global mode, where any process can consume mocks and stubs
  defined in your tests. To manually switch to global mode use:

      set_mox_global()

  which can be done as a setup callback:

      setup :set_mox_global
      setup :verify_on_exit!

      test "invokes add and mult from a task" do
        MyApp.CalcMock
        |> expect(:add, fn x, y -> x + y end)
        |> expect(:mult, fn x, y -> x * y end)

        Task.async(fn ->
          assert MyApp.CalcMock.add(2, 3) == 5
          assert MyApp.CalcMock.mult(2, 3) == 6
        end)
        |> Task.await
      end

  The global mode must always be explicitly set per test. By default
  mocks run on `private` mode.

  You can also automatically choose global or private mode depending on
  if your tests run in async mode or not. In such case Mox will use
  private mode when `async: true`, global mode otherwise:

      setup :set_mox_from_context

  ### Blocking on expectations

  If your mock is called in a different process than the test process,
  in some cases there is a chance that the test will finish executing
  before it has a chance to call the mock and meet the expectations.
  Imagine this:

      test "calling a mock from a different process" do
        expect(MyApp.CalcMock, :add, fn x, y -> x + y end)

        spawn(fn -> MyApp.CalcMock.add(4, 2) end)

        verify!()
      end

  The test above has a race condition because there is a chance that the
  `verify!/0` call will happen before the spawned process calls the mock.
  In most cases, you don't control the spawning of the process so you can't
  simply monitor the process to know when it dies in order to avoid this
  race condition. In those cases, the way to go is to "sync up" with the
  process that calls the mock by sending a message to the test process
  from the expectation and using that to know when the expectation has been
  called.

      test "calling a mock from a different process" do
        parent = self()
        ref = make_ref()

        expect(MyApp.CalcMock, :add, fn x, y ->
          send(parent, {ref, :add})
          x + y
        end)

        spawn(fn -> MyApp.CalcMock.add(4, 2) end)

        assert_receive {^ref, :add}

        verify!()
      end

  This way, we'll wait until the expectation is called before calling
  `verify!/0`.

  ## Skipping optional callbacks

  By default, functions are created for all callbacks, including all optional
  callbacks. But if for some reason you want to skip optional callbacks, you can
  provide the list of callback names to skip (along with their arities) as
  `:skip_optional_callbacks`:

      Mox.defmock(MyMock, for: MyBehaviour, skip_optional_callbacks: [on_success: 2])

  This will define a new mock (`MyMock`) that has a defined function for each
  callback on `MyBehaviour` except for `on_success/2`. Note: you can only skip
  optional callbacks, not required callbacks.

  You can also pass `true` to skip all optional callbacks, or `false` to keep
  the default of generating functions for all optional callbacks.

  ## Passing `@moduledoc`

  You can provide value for `@moduledoc` with `:moduledoc` option.

  Expects the `name` in `mock` with arity given by `code`
  to be invoked `n` times.

  If you're calling your mock from an asynchronous process and want
  to wait for the mock to be called, see the "Blocking on expectations"
  section in the module documentation.

  When `expect/4` is invoked, any previously declared `stub` for the same `name` and arity will
  be removed. This ensures that `expect` will fail if the function is called more than `n` times.
  If a `stub/3` is invoked **after** `expect/4` for the same `name` and arity, the stub will be
  used after all expectations are fulfilled.

  ## Examples

  To expect `MyMock.add/2` to be called once:

      expect(MyMock, :add, fn x, y -> x + y end)

  To expect `MyMock.add/2` to be called five times:

      expect(MyMock, :add, 5, fn x, y -> x + y end)

  To expect `MyMock.add/2` to not be called:

      expect(MyMock, :add, 0, fn x, y -> :ok end)

  `expect/4` can also be invoked multiple times for the same
  name/arity, allowing you to give different behaviours on each
  invocation:
